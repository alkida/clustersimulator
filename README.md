# Cluster Simulator

The project is structured as follows:
- The "Cluster" folder contains an Omnet++ project that simulates a Google Cluster
- The "generate_traces" folder contains some scripts that can be used to convert Google cluster data logs ( https://github.com/google/cluster-data/blob/master/ClusterData2011_2.md ) to a format that can be used by this simulator
